# TruLens + Google Vertex AI Tutorial: Building RAG Applications

## üåå Introduction: Unveiling the World of TruLens and AI

Hello and welcome to an enriching journey through the realms of artificial intelligence! In this extensive tutorial, we are going to dive deep into the capabilities of TruLens and Google Vertex AI. Whether you're a beginner in AI or someone looking to expand your skills, this guide will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of how to build intelligent, context-aware applications. Our focus will be on creating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, a type of application that combines the power of information retrieval and language generation to answer questions in a way that's both accurate and contextually rich.

## üöÄ Exploring TruLens and Its Capabilities

TruLens is a powerful tool that provides valuable insights into the inner workings of AI models. It stands out for its ability to make AI decision-making transparent, allowing developers to understand and improve their models effectively. In the world of AI where explanations are often as crucial as outcomes, TruLens is your ally in decoding the 'why' and 'how' behind your model's responses.

### Key Features of TruLens:

- **Insightful Interpretability**: üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Dive deep into the model's decision-making process, understanding the rationale behind each response.
- **Performance Analytics**: üìä Access detailed metrics that shed light on how well your model is performing against various benchmarks.
- **Iterative Improvement**: üîÅ Use the insights gained from TruLens to fine-tune and enhance your AI model, ensuring it not only meets but exceeds expectations.



## üõ† Part 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Step 1: Importing Libraries

```python
import os
import requests
import streamlit as st
import weaviate
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain
from langchain.chat_models import ChatVertexAI
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.vectorstores import Weaviate
from trulens_eval import Feedback, Huggingface, Tru, TruChain
from weaviate.embedded import EmbeddedOptions
```

- **Why These Imports?**
  - `os` and `requests`: For interacting with the operating system and fetching data from URLs.
  - `streamlit`: To create an interactive web application for your RAG system.
  - `weaviate`: A database client for handling vectorized data, crucial for RAG applications.

### Step 2: Environment Configuration

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
```

- **Loading Environment Variables**: Securely manage your API keys and configurations using environment variables.

### Step 3: Setting API Keys

```python
os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = os.getenv("GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS")
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
os.environ["HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY"] = os.getenv("HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY")
```

- **API Configuration**: These lines are crucial for accessing services like Google Vertex AI, OpenAI, and Huggingface.

## ü§ñ Part 2: Initializing Core AI Components

### Step 4: Initializing Huggingface and TruLens

```python
hugs = Huggingface()
tru = Tru()
```

- **Why Huggingface and TruLens?**
  - `Huggingface`: Provides NLP functionalities necessary for processing language.
  - `TruLens`: Monitors and enhances the AI model‚Äôs performance.

### Step 5: Setting Up Chain Recorder and Conversation

```python
chain_recorder = None
conversation = None

def handle_conversation(user_input):
    input_dict = {"question": user_input}
    try:
        with chain_recorder as recording:
            response = conversation(input_dict)
            return response.get("answer", "No response generated.")
    except Exception as e:
        return f"An error occurred: {e}"

```

- **Preparation for Conversational AI**: These components, once initialized, will manage the logic and recording of AI interactions.

## üåê Part 3: Creating the User Interface with Streamlit

### Step 6: Streamlit Sidebar for URL Input

```python
st.sidebar.title("Configuration")
url = st.sidebar.text_input("Enter URL")
submit_button = st.sidebar.button("Submit")
```

- **Interactive UI Setup**: This step allows users to input a document URL, which the RAG system will use.

## üìö Part 4: Data Processing and RAG System Setup

### Step 7: Handling Document Loading and RAG Initialization

```python
if 'initiated' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['initiated'] = False
    st.session_state['messages'] = []

if submit_button or st.session_state['initiated']:
    st.session_state['initiated'] = True

    if url and not conversation:
        # Load and process the document
        res = requests.get(url)
        with open("state_of_the_union.txt", "w") as f:
            f.write(res.text)

        loader = TextLoader('./state_of_the_union.txt')
        documents = loader.load()

        text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50)
        chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

        client = weaviate.Client(embedded_options=EmbeddedOptions())
        vectorstore = Weaviate.from_documents(client=client, documents=chunks, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(), by_text=False)
        
        retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()

        llm = ChatVertexAI()
        template = """You are an assistant for question-answering tasks..."""
        prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)
        memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm, memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)
        conversation = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm, retriever=retriever, memory=memory)

        chain_recorder = TruChain(
            conversation,
            app_id="RAG-System",
            feedbacks=[
                Feedback(hugs.language_match).on_input_output(),
                Feedback(hugs.not_toxic).on_output(),
                Feedback(hugs.pii_detection).on_input(),
                Feedback(hugs.positive_sentiment).on_output(),
            ]
        )
```

- **Conditional Data Loading**: This block ensures the RAG system initializes only after a document URL is provided.

## üí¨ Part 5: Building the Conversational Interface

### Step 8: Streamlit Frontend for User Interaction

```python
  st.title("RAG System powered by TruLens and Vertex AI")

      # Display chat messages
      for message in st.session_state.messages:
          st.write(f"{message['role']}: {message['content']}")

      # User input and response handling
      user_prompt = st.text_input("Your question:", key="user_input")
      if st.button("Send", key="send_button"):
          # Add user message to chat history
          st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_prompt})

          # Generate and display assistant response
          assistant_response = handle_conversation(user_prompt)

          # Update and display chat history
          st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": assistant_response})
          st.write(f"Assistant: {assistant_response}")

      # Run TruLens dashboard
      tru.run_dashboard()
  else:
      st.write("Please enter a URL and click submit to load the application.")
```

- **Developing the Chat Interface**: This section uses Streamlit to create a platform where users can interact with the RAG system.

## üìä Part 6: Integrating TruLens for Insights

### Step 9: Deploying the TruLens Dashboard

```python
tru.run_dashboard()
```

- **Performance Tracking**: The TruLens dashboard provides real-time insights into the RAG system's performance, aiding in continuous improvement.
